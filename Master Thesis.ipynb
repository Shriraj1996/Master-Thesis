    "###### Motivation: The motivation for a crop yield prediction project using machine learning algorithms is to improve the efficiency and productivity of agriculture, while also reducing costs and promoting sustainability. Accurate crop yield predictions can help farmers plan better, optimize resource use, and make better decisions about crop management practices. This can lead to higher profits for farmers, reduced waste, and a smaller environmental footprint. Ultimately, the goal of such a project is to improve outcomes for farmers, consumers, and the environment."

By using the warnings library, programmers can ensure that their code is reliable, maintainable, and compatible with different versions of Python and third-party libraries."

For data that follows a normal distribution, the values that fall more than three standard deviations from the mean are typically considered outliers. Outliers can find their way into a dataset naturally through variability, or they can be the result of issues like human error, faulty equipment, or poor sampling. Some outliers represent natural variations in the population, and they should be left as is in your dataset. These are called true outliers. Other outliers are problematic and should be removed because they represent measurement errors, data entry or processing errors, or poor sampling."

In the general case when the true y is non-constant, a constant model that always predicts the average y disregarding the input features would get a  score of 0.0. In the particular case when y_true is constant, the  score is not finite: it is either NaN (perfect predictions) or -Inf (imperfect predictions). To prevent such non-finite numbers to pollute higher-level experiments such as a grid search cross-validation, by default these cases are replaced with 1.0 (perfect predictions) or 0.0 (imperfect predictions) respectively. You can set force_finite to False to prevent this fix from happening."
